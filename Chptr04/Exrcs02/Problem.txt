Question: 
  What potential problem exists with the following snippet?

  year=$( date +%Y )
  month=$( date +%m )
  day=$( date +%d )
  hour=$( date +%H )
  minute=$( date +%M )
  second=$( date +%S )

Quotes:
  1. "Well, it is not exactly the same, because I ran the first command shortly
     before midnight and the second sortly after"
  2. "If the command substitution is not quoted, word splitting and pathname
     expansion are performed on the results."

Answer:
  Firstly, there seems to be space for improvement, since that way we are
  issuing date several times to get one single piece of information.
  In addition, as per above first statement there is a potential issue if above
  snippet is issued close enough to midnight. For instance, During August 31st
  snippet may start execution so close enough to midnight that we may be storing
  variables as this:
  * year=2016  # Assigned at 12:59:58 PM of Aug, 31st
  * month=08   # Assigned at 12:59:59
  * day=01     # Wrongly assigned at 00:00:00 AM of Sep, 1st
  Where we should have assigned variables as this:
  * year=2016 month=08 day=31
  Finally, as per the second statement, an additional potential
  problem may be the result of undesired subsecuent word splitting and pathname
  expansion of proposed command substitutions. A better example would be to
  contrast the execution of the following two sinppets:
  # echo $( echo './*' )
  # echo "$( echo './*' )"
  However since date with specified formats won't return any file globbing
  patterns we could discard such risk. 

  We recommend using something like this instead:
  read year month day hour minute second < <(date +'%Y %m %d %H %M %S')

  Or even better
  read year month day hour minute second <<EOF
  "$(date +'%Y %m %d %H %M %S')"
  EOF
