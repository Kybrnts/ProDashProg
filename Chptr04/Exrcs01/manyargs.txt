Question: 
  How many arguments are there on this command line? 
  sa $# $(date "+%Y %m %d") John\ Doe

Quote: 
  "When a line is executed, whether at the command prompt or in a script, the
  shell splits the line into words wherever there is unquoted white space. Then
  bash examines the resulting words, performing up to eight types of expansion
  on them as appropriate. The results of the expansions are passed to the
  command as its arguments."

0. sa $# $(date "+%Y %m %d") John\ Doe <- Four words available ("\" escapes
   space between "John" and "Doe");
1. No braces available, nothing to expand upon brace expansion;
2. No tilde character present, nothing to expand upon tilde expansion;
3. After parameter expansion $# Expands to 0;
4. No arithmetic expression available, nothing to expand upon arithmetic
   expansion;
5. After command substitution $(date "+Y %m %d") is expanded to current YYYY mm
   dd (3 words);
6. After word splitting upon arguments, we have: 0 YYYY mm dd John\ Doe;
7. No file globbing patterns available, nothing to expand upon pathname
   expansion;
8. No temporary filename-for-command allocated, nothing to expand upon process
   substitution;

Answer:
  Therefore After expansion is completed we remain with the following arguments:
  0 YYYY mm dd John\ Doe; Total: 5.
