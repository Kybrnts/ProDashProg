Redirection is performed before command execution so in mentioned command, file
"$HOME/tmp" is first truncated, then "tr" will attempt to read from it, but
nothing is there, since it has already been truncated. Therefore nothing will be
translated, and that is wrong.

As it is stated in page 14:
   "If you redirect to the same file you are reading from, that file will be
   truncated, and the command will have nothing to read."

Mentioned command does exactly that, and that is what it is wrong with it.
