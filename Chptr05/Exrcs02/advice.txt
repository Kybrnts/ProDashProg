Question:
  I advise against using single-letter variables names but give a couple of
  places where they are reasonable. Can you think of any other legitimate uses
  for them?

Quotes:
  * "Single-letter names should be used rarely. They are appropriate as the
    index in a loop, where its sole function is as a counter. The letter
    traditionally used for this purpose is i, but I prefer n."
  * "The only other place I use single-letter variable names is when reading
    throwaway material from a file."

Answer:
  We would argue in favor of using sigle-letter names for:
  * Math problems, e.g. x, y as coordinates;
  * Small scope variables;
  * Short shell snippets for the interactive command line where the shorter the
    expresion, the merrier.
